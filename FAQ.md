# DLT-Security-Framework FAQ

## What is the DLT-Security-Framework?

The DLT Security Framework is an industry wide effort (currently focussing on the finance industry) to create a set of documentation, tools, checklists, operational guides and more for DLT and Blockchain security.

## What problem does the DLT-Security-Framework solve?

Currently there are no public high-level or technology specific security frameworks for DLT and Blockchain. This working group aims to solve this problem, providing both high-level guidance, checklists, technology specific guidance and tooling.

## Why is the DLT-Security-Framework focussing on the Finance Industry?

We are focussing on the Finance Industry first simply to reduce the scope of work to a manageable level. Longer term we plan to expand the scope to other industries, if you are interested in this please contact us at [PLACEHOLDER TO SIGNUP FORM].

## How does the DLT-Security-Framework work with “as-a-Service” options?

The DLT-Security-Framework will be taking a number of common deployment strategies into account, ranging from on premises to fully hosted as well as multi-host options.

## Who is involved in the DLT-Security-Framework?

Currently the DLT-Security-Framework working group has participants from several dozen companies and organizations. Involvement is open to the public and we welcome everyone who wants to help and add value.

## What other security efforts are present in this space? Why aren’t you working with them?

There are a number of related efforts however most are either only high level guidance, or are vendor/technology specific. The DLT Security Framework aims to not only combine and coordinate at multiple levels but to also provide actual tooling and automation for all participants in DLT and Blockchain networks.

## How do I participate in the DLT-Security-Framework?

The [CSA Circle Platform hosts the DLT Security Framework discussions](https://circle.cloudsecurityalliance.org/search?s=%23DLTFRAMEWORK&executesearch=true) working groups and you can find more information there.

## Will there be a way to show compliance with the DLT-Security-Framework?

Several parties have expressed interest in converting the work done by the DLT-Security-Framework project into machine readable formats for use in additional systems to ensure compliance, automate configuration and so on. At a minimum the DLT-Security-Framework project will be producing checklists and other guidance documentation that can be used to show compliance.
